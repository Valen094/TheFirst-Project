                    <h3>GITHUB</h3><br>

                    <p>At a high level, GitHub is a <strong> <em> website </em></strong> and <strong> <em> cloud-based
                            </em></strong> service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track
                        and control changes to their code. To understand exactly what GitHub is, you need to know two
                        connected principles:</p><br>

                    </h3> <br>

                    <p> In this article, we’ll first explain those two principles. Then, we’ll dig into more about
                        GitHub and how you can actually use <strong> <em>GitHub </em> </strong> to work with <strong>
                            <em>WordPress</em></strong> and/or <strong> <em>Kinsta. </em></strong></p>

                <h2>What Is Version Control?</h2><br>
                <div class="Elements2">
                    <h3>Version control helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code. As a
                        software project grows, version control becomes essential. Take WordPress…</h3><br>

                    <p>At this point, WordPress is a pretty big project. If a core developer wanted to work on one
                        specific part of the WordPress codebase, it wouldn’t be safe or efficient to have them directly
                        edit the “official” source code.

                        Instead, version control lets developers safely work through branching and merging.

                        With branching, a developer duplicates part of the source code (called the repository). The
                        developer can then safely make changes to that part of the code without affecting the rest of
                        the project.

                        Then, once the developer gets his or her part of the code working properly, he or she can merge
                        that code back into the main source code to make it official.

                        All of these changes are then tracked and can be reverted if need be.</p>

                    <h3>Git is a specific open-source version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.</h3><br>

                    <p>Specifically, Git is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase
                        and history is available on every developer’s computer, which allows for easy branching and
                        merging.

                        According to a Stack Overflow developer survey, over 87% of developers use Git.</p>

                    <h3>The most important</h3><br>

                    <p>GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service.
                        Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control
                        and collaboration.

                        GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git.
                        Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command
                        line.

                        GitHub is so user-friendly, though, that some people even use GitHub to manage other types of
                        projects – like writing books.

                        Additionally, anyone can sign up and host a public code repository for free, which makes GitHub
                        especially popular with open-source projects.

                        As a company, GitHub makes money by selling hosted private code repositories, as well as other
                        business-focused plans that make it easier for organizations to manage team members and
                        security.</p>
